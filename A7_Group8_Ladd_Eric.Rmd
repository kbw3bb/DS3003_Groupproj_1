# Group Homework 

- You will work with your group to complete this assignment.

- *Submit your group's shared `.Rmd` AND "knitted"`.html` files*
    
    +  Your "knitted .html" submission must be created from your "group .Rmd" but be created on your own computer
    
    + Confirm this with the following comment included in your submission text box: **"Honor Pledge: I have recreated my group submission using using the tools I have installed on my own computer"**
    
    + Name the files with a group name and YOUR name for your submission

*Each group member must be able to submit this assignment as created from their own computer. If only some members of the group submit the required files, those group members must additionally provide a supplemental explanation along with their submission as to why other students in their group have not completed this assignment.*

# Part 1 

- Use the SCS Data set you downloaded from Collab for Assignments 4 and 5, and then investigate the relationship between the mathematics achievement score (“mathpre”) and the math anxiety score (“mars”) by plotting the data and the path of means. 
```{r}
library(foreign)
library (ggplot2)
library(car)

scs <- read.spss("SCS_QE.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE)
```

- Don't use package `ggplot2` for Part 1. Use `ggplot2` for Part 2.

(1) Produce a scatterplot between “mathpre” and “mars” (you might consider using `jitter()` or `alpha()` for avoiding overlying points) and add a regression smoother using `loess()`. Compare the resulting plot to the plot you obtain by using `scatterplot()` from the `car`-package.
 
```{r}
#plot(jitter(scs$mars, factor = 2), jitter(scs$mathpre, factor = 2))

?plot

out.all = loess(mars ~ mathpre, scs, span = .5, degree =2)
x.val = seq(25, 125, by = 0.5)

lines(x.val, predict(out.all, x.val), lwd = 3, lty = 2)
```


(2) Draw separate regression smoothers for female and male students (variable “male”). Use `loess()`.

```{r}
# add your codes
```


(3) Describe the roles of regression smoothers in finding a relationship between math scores and math anxiety. 



For (1), you should produce plots similar to the following ones [‘play’ with the `span` argument in `loess()`]:

For (2), you should produce a plot similar to the following one:

![](A7_Q2.png)


# Part 2

- Re-do **Part 1** using package `ggplot2`. That is, 

(1) Produce a scatterplot (you might consider using `geom_jitter()` or the argument `alpha` from package `ggplot2` for avoiding overlying points) and add a regression smoother using `geom_smooth()`. 

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_jitter(data=scs, aes(x=mars, y=mathpre)) + stat_smooth(data=scs, aes(x=mars, y=mathpre), method = "loess")

str(scs)
class(scs)

```

(2) Draw separate regression smoothers for female and male students (variable “male”). Use package `ggplot2`.

```{r}
# add your codes
```


# Part 3

- Use a dataset in data repositories (e.g., [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)) that gives the measurements in different conditions like `iris` data. For more info on `iris` data, use `?iris`.

- Briefly describe the dataset you're using for this assignment (e.g., means to access data, context, sample, variables, etc...).

   + *describe your data.*
   
- Transform the dataset from a wide to a long format. Produce any ggplot where the key variable is used in function `facet_grid` or `facet_wrap`.

- Here is one example we used in class. You may want to delete the below example when you submit your files.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)


degrees = read.csv('degrees-that-pay-back.csv')
names(degrees)
longdeg = degrees %>% gather(degrees, key = percentile, value = 'Mid-career salary', Mid.Career.10th.Percentile.Salary:Mid.Career.90th.Percentile.Salary) %>% 
longdeg

top5_longdeg = 

bot5_longdeg = 



longiris <- gather(iris, key = flower_att, value = measurement, 
                    Sepal.Length:Petal.Width)

longiris
ggplot(longiris, aes(x=Species, y=measurement)) + geom_boxplot() + 
   facet_grid(~ flower_att) + theme_bw()
```
